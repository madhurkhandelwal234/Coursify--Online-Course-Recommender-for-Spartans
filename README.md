## Problem:
As students, we face a lot of problems while selecting courses each semester. 
The plethora of options to choose from, the knowledge of our choices and their alignment with our interests confuse us all the more. And after all this the valid pre and corequisite choices also come up. After flipping through web pages, talking to people we gather all the data, but what we need is concrete information. COURSIFY aims to solve exactly these problems.


## Solution:
Coursify has three major modules.

### 1. Feedback Analyzer
The feedback module is where students provide feedback, if they have taken a course previously under a professor. This data helps in creating course plans for future students. Our intelligent system grabs information form theses feedbacks and aggreagated them.

### 2. Course Recommender
To create a course plan for themselves students need to provide required information as itâ€™s asked for. We have kept the process very simple for you, you just have to select a few options. Based on these provided inputs Coursify will do the number crunching and generate a degree plan for you. It intelligently takes care of all the pre-req and co-req requirements for you and suggests courses according to your technology likings.

### 3. Interactive course load manager
The courses suggested above are not only static but, you can arranage them as you like and coursify will work in the background analysing them. Courses that don't satisfy pre-req or co-req conditions, they automagically change color to red, thus gaining user attention.

## User Stories:
As a student I want to provide feedback about a course that I took under a Professor, so that my experience can be shared.<br/>
As a student I want to create a course plan so that I can finish my graduation program.<br/>
As a suggestive web app I want to take inputs so that I can create and suggest a course plan on basis of that.

NOTE: We have limited data as of now. So course recommnedation will only work for the data which we have. (You can try with web technologes for example.) As user inputs more data, our systems keeps on learning. Even you can provide data about a course and review the technologies from the [ones which we presently track](https://github.com/SJSU272Lab/coursify/blob/master/Flask/recommender/tech_list.json)
